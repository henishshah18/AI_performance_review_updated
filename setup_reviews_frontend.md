## üîß Integration Steps

### 1. Update App.tsx Routes

Replace the placeholder reviews route in `src/App.tsx`:

```tsx
// Add imports at the top
import { ReviewsPage } from './pages/reviews/ReviewsPage';
import { SelfAssessmentPage } from './pages/reviews/SelfAssessmentPage';
import { PeerReviewPage } from './pages/reviews/PeerReviewPage';

// Replace the existing /reviews route with:
<Route 
  path="/reviews" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <Layout>
        <ReviewsPage />
      </Layout>
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>

// Add new routes:
<Route 
  path="/reviews/self-assessment" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <SelfAssessmentPage />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>

<Route 
  path="/reviews/self-assessment/:cycleId" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <SelfAssessmentPage />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>

<Route 
  path="/reviews/self-assessment/:cycleId/:assessmentId" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <SelfAssessmentPage />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>

<Route 
  path="/reviews/peer-review" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <PeerReviewPage />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>

<Route 
  path="/reviews/peer-review/:cycleId/:revieweeId" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <PeerReviewPage />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>

<Route 
  path="/reviews/peer-review/:cycleId/:revieweeId/:reviewId" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <PeerReviewPage />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>
```

### 2. Update Components Index

Add to `src/components/index.ts`:

```tsx
