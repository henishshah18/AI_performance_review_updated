## **API Security & Rate Limiting**

### **Authentication Requirements**
- All endpoints require valid JWT token except authentication endpoints
- Token must be included in Authorization header: `Bearer <token>`
- Tokens expire after 15 minutes (access) / 7 days (refresh)

### **Role-Based Access Control**
- **HR Admin**: Full access to all endpoints
- **Manager**: Department-scoped access to team data
- **Individual Contributor**: Access to own data only

### **Rate Limiting**
- **Authentication endpoints**: 5 requests per minute per IP
- **General endpoints**: 100 requests per minute per user
- **AI endpoints**: 20 requests per minute per user
- **Export endpoints**: 5 requests per hour per user

### **Data Filtering Rules**
- **Department Filtering**: Managers can only access users from their department
- **Team Filtering**: Managers can only manage direct reports
- **Ownership Filtering**: Users can only edit items they created or are assigned to
- **Status Filtering**: Cannot edit items with status "completed" or "overdue"

## **API Versioning & Deprecation**

### **Current Version**
- **API Version**: v1
- **Base URL**: `/api/v1/`
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`

### **Backward Compatibility**
- Breaking changes will increment major version
- Deprecated endpoints will be supported for 6 months
- New optional fields can be added without version increment

### **Response Headers**
```
X-API-Version: 1.0
X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: 95
X-Rate-Limit-Reset: 1642234567
X-Request-ID: uuid-for-debugging
```

## **Business Logic Constraints (API Level)**

### **Timeline Validation**
- Goal due dates must be ≤ objective end dates
- Task due dates must be ≤ goal due dates
- Cannot create items with past due dates
- Cannot extend deadlines for overdue items

### **Permission Constraints**
- Managers can only assign goals to direct reports
- Users cannot give feedback to themselves
- Cannot edit items after status changes to "in_progress"
- HR Admin required for objective and review cycle management

### **Data Integrity Rules**
- Goal titles must be unique within objective
- Task titles must be unique within goal
- Progress percentages must be 0-100
- Cannot delete items with active children

### **Department & Role Constraints**
- Managers can only access users from their department
- Individual contributors must have exactly one manager
- Department managers must have manager or hr_admin role
- Cannot assign users to departments they don't belong to

## **Performance Optimization**

### **Caching Strategy**
- **Dashboard data**: 5 minute cache
- **User profiles**: 15 minute cache
- **Department lists**: 1 hour cache
- **System settings**: 24 hour cache

### **Pagination**
- Default page size: 20 items
- Maximum page size: 100 items
- Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- Include total count in response headers

### **Query Optimization**
- Use database indexes for all foreign key relationships
- Implement query result caching for expensive operations
- Batch API calls where possible
- Use select_related/prefetch_related for Django ORM

### **Response Optimization**
- Compress responses with gzip
- Use ETags for conditional requests
- Implement partial response fields (?fields=id,name,status)
- Return minimal data for list endpoints, full data for detail endpoints
