Actions: [Cancel] [Save as Draft] [Create & Launch] [Schedule Launch]
```

### **Review Cycle Management**
```
Active Cycle Controls:
├── Phase Management
│   ├── [Extend Phase Deadline] (emergency extension)
│   ├── [Send Reminders] (manual reminder triggers)
│   ├── [View Laggards] (participants behind schedule)
│   └── [Generate Interim Report] (mid-cycle insights)
├── Participant Management
│   ├── [Add Participants] (late joiners, new hires)
│   ├── [Remove Participants] (role changes, departures)
│   ├── [Manage Exceptions] (medical leave, extended absence)
│   └── [View Individual Progress] (per-person status)
├── Communication Tools
│   ├── [Send Announcement] (company-wide updates)
│   ├── [Department Reminders] (targeted communications)
│   ├── [Manager Briefings] (role-specific instructions)
│   └── [FAQ Management] (common questions handling)
└── Quality Control
    ├── [Review Calibration] (manager alignment checks)
    ├── [Data Quality Audit] (incomplete/inconsistent reviews)
    ├── [Conflict Resolution] (escalated issues)
    └── [Bias Detection] (algorithmic fairness checks)
```

### **Critical Edge Cases**
```
Overlapping Cycles:
- System prevents creation of overlapping active cycles
- Show error: "Cannot create overlapping review cycles"
- Suggest alternative dates based on cycle history

Mid-Cycle Changes:
- Employee role change → maintain current assignments, update future permissions
- Manager change → transfer review responsibilities to new manager
- Department transfer → update participant groupings

Cycle Interruption:
- System outage → auto-extend deadlines, preserve all submitted data
- Emergency suspension → pause all timers, maintain submission states
- Data corruption → rollback capabilities, audit trail preservation
```
