## 🏗️ Implementation Details

### 1. **Database Models** (4 models, ~592 lines)

#### **Objective Model**
- **Purpose**: Company/Department level objectives created by HR Admin
- **Key Features**:
  - UUID primary key for security
  - Owner assignment (managers only)
  - Department many-to-many relationship
  - Timeline validation (quarterly: 80-100 days, yearly: 350-380 days)
  - Automatic progress calculation from goals
  - Status tracking with overdue detection
- **Business Rules**:
  - Only HR Admin can create objectives
  - Only managers can own objectives
  - Timeline type must match duration
  - Cannot delete with active goals

#### **Goal Model**
- **Purpose**: Team-level goals created by managers under objectives
- **Key Features**:
  - Assigned to individual contributors
  - Due date validation within objective timeline
  - Automatic progress calculation from tasks
  - Department alignment enforcement
  - Manager-direct report relationship validation
- **Business Rules**:
  - Only managers can create goals
  - Only individual contributors can be assigned goals
  - Must be in same department as creator
  - Due date cannot exceed objective end date

#### **IndividualTask Model**
- **Purpose**: Individual work items created by employees under goals
- **Key Features**:
  - Manual progress percentage input
  - Evidence links (JSON field with validation)

  - Update notes and evidence tracking
  - Significant update detection (>10% change)
  - Automatic creation on task updates

### 2. **API Implementation** (~543 lines)

#### **Objective Endpoints**
- `GET/POST /api/okr/objectives/` - List/create objectives (role-filtered)
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/okr/objectives/{id}/` - Objective details
- Role-based filtering: HR Admin sees all, Managers see owned/department, Individuals see department

#### **Goal Endpoints**
- `GET/POST /api/okr/objectives/{id}/goals/` - List/create goals for objective
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/okr/goals/{id}/` - Goal details
- Manager-only creation, individual contributor assignment

#### **Task Endpoints**
- `GET/POST /api/okr/goals/{id}/tasks/` - List/create tasks for goal
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/okr/tasks/{id}/` - Task details
- `PUT /api/okr/tasks/{id}/progress/` - Update task progress with tracking

#### **User-Specific Endpoints**
- `GET /api/okr/my-objectives/` - Current user's objectives (role-based)
- `GET /api/okr/my-goals/` - Current user's goals
- `GET /api/okr/my-tasks/` - Current user's tasks
- `GET /api/okr/analytics/` - OKR analytics data (role-filtered)

### 3. **Serializers** (~412 lines)

#### **Comprehensive Serialization**
- **ObjectiveSerializer**: Full objective data with nested goals
- **GoalSerializer**: Goal data with nested tasks and progress metrics
- **IndividualTaskSerializer**: Task data with evidence links and updates
- **TaskUpdateSerializer**: Progress update tracking
- **List Serializers**: Lightweight versions for list views
- **ProgressUpdateSerializer**: Specialized for progress updates

#### **Validation Features**
- Timeline type validation
- Role-based assignment validation
- Evidence links format validation
- Department alignment checks
- Manager-direct report relationship validation

### 4. **Django Admin Integration** (~443 lines)

#### **Rich Admin Interface**
- **Visual Progress Bars**: Color-coded progress indicators
- **Status Badges**: Color-coded status displays
- **Priority Badges**: Priority level indicators
- **Relationship Links**: Navigate between related objects
- **Bulk Actions**: Activate, complete, calculate progress
- **Advanced Filtering**: Status, priority, department, date filters
- **Search Functionality**: Full-text search across relevant fields

### 5. **Business Rules Engine**

#### **Automatic Progress Calculation**
- Tasks → Goals: Average of task progress percentages
- Goals → Objectives: Average of goal progress percentages
- Real-time updates when any level changes
- Cascade updates through the hierarchy

#### **Status Management**
- Automatic overdue detection based on dates
- Status transition validation
- Completion timestamp tracking
- Blocker reason enforcement

#### **Access Control**
- Role-based data filtering at all levels
- Department-based access restrictions
- Manager-direct report relationship enforcement
- Creation permission validation
